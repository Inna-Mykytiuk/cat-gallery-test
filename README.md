# **Junior Frontend Developer Test Case - Cat Gallery**

**Overview**
Create a web application that displays a gallery of cat images fetched from the TheCatAPI. Users should be able to filter the cats by breed and favorite/unfavorite individual cats.

**Requirements**

1. **Cat Image Gallery**:
   - Fetch cat images and associated data (e.g., breed, temperament) from the TheCatAPI.
   - Display the cat images in a responsive grid or masonry layout.
   - Include the cat's breed name as a caption below each image.
2. **Breed Filtering**:
   - Allow users to filter the displayed cats by breed.
   - Provide a dropdown or search input to select the desired breed.
   - Update the gallery to show only the cats that match the selected breed.
3. **Favoriting Cats**:
   - Implement a "Favorite" button or icon for each cat image.
   - Allow users to mark a cat as a favorite, and persist this information in the browser's local storage.
   - Visually differentiate the favorite cats from the non-favorite ones in the gallery.
   - Provide a way for users to view only their favorite cats.
4. **React Components and State Management**:
   - Use functional components with React Hooks for state management and side effects.
   - Manage state efficiently using React Context API or a lightweight state management library like Zustand (if you think itâ€™s needed).
5. **API Integration**:
   - Fetch cat data from the TheCatAPI using the provided API endpoints and documentation (React Query)
   - Handle API errors and provide meaningful feedback to the user.
6. **UI and Styling**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling the application.
   - Ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
7. **Code Organization and Best Practices**:
   - Organize the codebase in a clear and modular fashion.
   - Follow best practices for React development
8. Utils:
   - React Query
   - TypeScript
   - Vite
   - Husky
   - Linters
9. **Deployment**:

   - Deploy the application to a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages) and provide the deployment URL.
